Instagram API Feed

Embed Instagram content on your website using an API feed. 

This tool is for anybody who wants to have Instagram content on their website. If you have no technical experience, the code can be copy and pasted and will work very easily. If you are a developer, the code is editable so you can tweak the functionality as required.

Main features:
- Biography section that displays account information such as name, followers, following, posts and biography.
- Image section that displays the latest 4 images from an Instagram account with a hover effect that shows the number of likes and comments on each post.
- Both sections are responsive and use breakpoints inline with Bootstrap 3.

Dependencies:
- JQuery
- Font Awesome

Additional notes / considerations:
- The code is editable so that the Instagram account can be changed very easily.
Note: The account used must be a public account. Private accounts will not work for this tool.
- The number of posts shown can be edited very easily by changing the maxPosts variable.
- Look in developer console to see the full list of data available from Instagram.
- Two JS functions are used: 1) to format the numbers e.g. 1000 becomes 1K etc. 2) Resize the images to ensure they are always square.
